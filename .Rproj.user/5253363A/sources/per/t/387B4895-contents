In this study, three types of sludge-derived biochars (BC<sub>1</sub>, BC<sub>2</sub> and BC<sub>3</sub>) were prepared by 1) original sludge, 2) sludge after K<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> conditioning, and 3) sludge after acidification + K<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> conditioning. The results show that the biochar prepared from the conditioned sludge has additional functional groups, and its Pb<sup>2+</sup> removal effect is greatly enhanced. The concentration of Pb2+ in the effluent can be reduced to <0.06 Î¼g/L. The original sludge-derived biochar can only remove at most 58.02% of Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The maximum adsorption capacity of BC3 is six times greater than that of BC1. The ion exchange effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the biochar surface and the complexation of free -OH or -COOH functional groups lead to an excellent adsorption effect on Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The sludge-derived biochar prepared after the conditioning of K<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> can realize efficient removal of Pb<sup>2+</sup>, providing new initiatives for subsequent sludge resource utilization.
